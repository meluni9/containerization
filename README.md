# Lab 3 – Containerization

This repository contains three containerized applications written in different languages:

- **Python (FastAPI)**  
  A simple API endpoint `/api/matrix` that returns the product of two random 10×10 matrices.

- **Go (Cobra CLI)**  
  A CLI tool with `serve` and `query` commands for the classic FizzBuzz problem, including a simple web interface.

- **JavaScript (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)**  
  A basic REST API for notes. Supports creating and retrieving notes.
